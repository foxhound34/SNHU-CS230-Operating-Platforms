Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I was particularly proud of the work I did on the development reqirements section. For the server side I determined the costs for various server types and weighed the pros and cons of each, for the client side I talked about the authentication and security protocols for all OSs.  Finally, I showed all the development tools asspociated with weach and a cost breakdown 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document helos determine the expnase and limitations of the software based on the clients needs, budget, and time constratints

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose the design constraints.  Having only the knowledge from the prompt was difficult, in reality a back and forth conversation would be needed to accurately determine what the companies constraints are.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Ultimately, it is the user experience that should take precendence, with out a userbase the company can not survive.  To determine the users needs I would have to play test the game over and over to determine the best design choices that would keep the players engaged.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
